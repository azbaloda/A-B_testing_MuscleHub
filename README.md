# A-B_testing_MuscleHub

## Project Goals

Congratulations! You‚Äôve been hired as the newest member of the data analytics team at MuscleHub, a fancy gym, and your first assignment is to run an A/B test!

Currently, when a MuscleHub visitor purchases a membership, they follow the following steps:

1) Take a fitness test with a personal trainer.

2) Fill out an application for the gym.

3) Send in their payment for their first month‚Äôs membership.

Janet, the manager of MuscleHub, thinks that the fitness test intimidates some prospective members, so she has set up an A/B test.

Visitors are randomly be assigned to one of two groups:

Group A is still asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer.

Group B skips the fitness test and proceed directly to the application.

Janet‚Äôs hypothesis is that visitors assigned to Group B will be more likely to eventually purchase a membership to MuscleHub than visitors assigned to Group A. So that the null and alternate hypotheses are as follows:

**Null Hypothesis** = There will no difference between the visitors in Group A that purchase membership and the visitors in Group B that purchase membership.

**Alternate Hypothesis** = There will be more visitors in Group B that will purchase membership than visitors in Group A that will purchase membership.
The significance threshold we will set as the benchmark to either accept or fail to reject the null hypothesis will be:

**ùõº** = 0.05

You will help her analyze the data and conducting A/B testing with Python.
